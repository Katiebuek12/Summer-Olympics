<p> Swimming became a sport in the early 19th century, and became a sport in the Olympics in <br>1896. The first events were the crawl, which was renamed as freestyle, and breaststroke. <br>In 1904 backstroke was added. In the 1940s swimmers found that they could go faster in<br> breaststroke by bringing both their arms forward and above their heads. This was banned in<br> breaststroke, thus creating butterfly. Butterfly first appeared at the Melbourne Games in 1956.<br> Women's swimming was added in 1912 at the Stockholm Games.</p>
